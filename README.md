# Ftxui components

Many of the standard ftxui components are arguably severely lacking. This mini-library exists to bridge the gap of useful and flexible components.

This library requires C++20, and is targeted at ftxui's master branch, due to 3.0.0 being [broken on Clang 14/15](https://github.com/ArthurSonzogni/FTXUI/pull/421), and no other versions existing at the time of writing.

**NOTE:** This library does NOT include ftxui itself! It has to be installed and linked separately. This is done to avoid version conflicts and build system integration fuckery. Get it yourself with Your Favorite Installation Method:tm:
